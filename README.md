##Machine Maker

This is a work in progress.

##Background

The Cookâ€“Levin theorem proves SAT is NP-complete, in part, by demonstrating a
polynonial-time reduction from any non-deterministic Turing machine to SAT. In
practice, this reduction is rarely constructed for any practical application.

Under normal circumstances, a Turing machine description and an initial
configuration are provided and the resulting SAT problem is satisfiable if the
machine represented by the SAT problem accepts its input.

##This project

This project explores a novel application of this reduction. Instead of
providing a machine description and initial configuration, it provides multiple
input/output pairs that specify how the machine should behave, i.e. what its
description should be to produce each computation.

More to come...
